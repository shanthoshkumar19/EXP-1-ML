# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-for-Predicting-Car-Prices
## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using a linear regression model and test the assumptions for linear regression.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and linear regression.
2. Load the car price dataset and perform basic preprocessing.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing data.
4. Train a linear regression model using the training data.
5. Predict car prices, evaluate the model, and test linear regression assumptions.
 
## Program:

## Result:
Thus, the program to implement a linear regression model for predicting car prices is written and verified using Python programming, along with the testing of key assumptions for linear regression.
